# MobWeb_UpdateTransactionIncrementIds extension for Magento

A simple extension that updates the increment IDs for new orders, invoices and shipments on the first day of each month. Useful if you want your transactions' increment IDs to indicate the month in which they occurred.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Configuration

No configuration available, but you might have to customize the helper class to implement your own logic for determing the format of the increment IDs.

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
